# AutoRAG
This is a Python RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using AutoGen and Gemini 2.0 Flash. It creates interactive chatbots that can answer questions by retrieving relevant context from various document sources: FLAML docs, Natural Questions dataset, multi-hop QA corpus, or local files.
